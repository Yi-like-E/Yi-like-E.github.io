# Web Wildlife Walk

:deciduous_tree: :rabbit2: :bug: :beetle: :honeybee: :hamster: :hibiscus:

The site contains a search bar to locate the observed animals/plants near by with a filter that can list either native or endangered species. 

There's also a form for user to sends the observed animals/plants that are not currently on the list

The site is built on top of the work from Prof. David Humphrey from Seneca college. 

I made the search bar, observation form, inplemented few functions(validate, search) in both search.js and validate.js then did minor tweaking to the css.

Note: The form doesn't really get sent to iNaturalist, it's a mock up form but the constraints for each fields are working.
